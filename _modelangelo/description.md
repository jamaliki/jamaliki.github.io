excerpt: "*ModelAngelo* is an automated cryo-EM atomic model building software. It is free and available for everyone to use on [Github](https://github.com/3dem/model-angelo). You can find the pre-print on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00006). If you have an interesting use case, and *especially* if you have good resolution maps with unknown protein sequences, please reach out to me!
In the future, this page will include a fully worked through tutorial along with example output. For now, you can enjoy this picture of *ModelAngelo*'s output on PHFs.
