Hi! I am Kiarash Jamali, a machine learning researcher currently applying it to structural biology.
I got my B.S.c in mathematics and statistics from the University of Toronto, St George in 2021. 
While in Toronto, I was at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) as a machine learning researcher being supervised by [Frank Rudzicz](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~frank/). 
While there I worked mostly on developing new neural network architectures, specifically for [GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08081) and for [metrics](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJeiDpVFPr). 
In the summer of 2019, as part of UofT's [PEY program](https://engineeringcareers.utoronto.ca/work-experience-programs/professional-experience-year-co-op-program-pey-co-op/), I had a lot of fun working as a machine learning researcher at RBC Capital Markets on the [Aiden project](https://www.rbccm.com/en/expertise/electronic-trading/aiden/from-the-whiteboard.page). Aiden is a first-of-its-kind reinforcement learning agent that executes large equities orders on behalf of RBC's clients in the market while minimizing the slippage that is the consequence of such large orders. 

After graduating in the winter of 2020, I started working for [Semantic Health](https://www.semantichealth.ai/) as a machine learning scientist.
